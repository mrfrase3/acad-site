      <description>Chromeduino is a coding interface made for ChromeOS. The project was originally created by Casey Halverson (Spaceneedle) and was lacking in terms of features and stability. As this application is the only free option for coding Arduinos with ChromeOS, there is a need for such a tool in classrooms, where all the students have educational Chromebooks but the teacher/school does not have the resources to pay for the other editors.</description>

      <description>This server uses a-painter&amp;rsquo;s main repo, except instead of using a cli webpack server, it hosts its own express server with webpack implemented and then runs a socket.io server on top. It also injects the multiplayer layer into the client application.
This serves as a basic example and the method can easily be modified to support different communication types, like mongo, firebase, webRTC, etc&amp;hellip;</description>
