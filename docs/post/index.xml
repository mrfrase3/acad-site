      <description>Having looked at other peoples projects of LED matrix screens, I have always wanted to make one. The only problem was that I did not have a compelling project to force me to do it until a few months ago where a mate of mine, Alex, showed me a tix clock and I was instantly hooked.
The concept is pretty simple, the clock is in 24 hour time with each section correlating to a digit.</description>

      <description>Check out what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with the Web Audio API more specifically using it for visualisers.
One of the main reasons this API exists is to make visualisers for audio, but for some reason, you don&amp;rsquo;t see this very much on the internet. Why is something that is beyond me, but in the mean time, I&amp;rsquo;m having fun with it.
Another API that&amp;rsquo;s been around is matter js, a physics engine written in js for browsers.</description>
