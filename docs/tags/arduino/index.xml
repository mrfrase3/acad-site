      <description>Having looked at other peoples projects of LED matrix screens, I have always wanted to make one. The only problem was that I did not have a compelling project to force me to do it until a few months ago where a mate of mine, Alex, showed me a tix clock and I was instantly hooked.
The concept is pretty simple, the clock is in 24 hour time with each section correlating to a digit.</description>
